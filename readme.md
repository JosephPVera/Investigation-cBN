# Investigation-cBN
c-BN, a semiconductor material with an ultra-wide band gap, will be the object of study in this thesis. The study of this novel material will be carried out by considering different point defects and their potential for QT applications. The selection of defect candidates to study in an initial screening process will be based on the available literature, and especially promising defects will be chosen to be studied in more detail. The main idea of this thesis project is to identify defects in c-BN that can be used as qubits in a quan- tum platform. Simulations using Density functional theory (DFT) for point defects will be very important to obtain calculations that provide us with information about which defects are suitable for qubits. It will be important to carry out calculations of initial defect properties for several defects, including formation energy diagrams, spin state and zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy.

**DFT-calculations** folder contains information on simulation for phonon, bulk properties (Primitive), and Point defects (Data and promising). Here, several point defects are analyzed with ab initio simulations (VASP package) using PBE and HSE06 functionals.  This folder includes plots of Kohn-Sham (KS) levels diagrams, formation energy diagrams and localization of states. The plots for localization of states using PBE functional (in [PBE folder](https://github.com/JosephPVera/Investigation-cBN/tree/main/DFT-calculations/Point-Defects-Data/PBE)) is analyzed through the Projected Density of States (PDOS) onto s,p, and d orbitals, while using the HSE06 functional (in [HSE06 folder](https://github.com/JosephPVera/Investigation-cBN/tree/main/DFT-calculations/Point-Defects-Data/HSE06)) it is analyzed through PDOS and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR). The path of this analysis is shown in the following workflow:

Furthermore, details of the arrangement of the energy levels in KS level diagrams such as energy, occupancy, and contribution of ions in a given band is shown in **localized_(defect).dat** files. Pre-simulations for obtaining the formation and KS level energy diagrams can be seen in the following workflow:

Finally, details on the convergences for cutoff energy, k-density, size of the supercell, spin state in defects, magnetization, and Zero Phonon line is included in **Document** folder.
